Web Summit

The Web Summit is an annual technology conference held in Dublin since 2010. The event is run by a company called Ci, who also run events throughout the world including RISE in Hong Kong, Collision in the US and MoneyConf in Belfast. It has been called "the best technology conference on the planet" by Forbes. 

The event is held over three days in Dublin and has increased from 400 attendees in the first year to over 30,000 four years later. People from over a hundred countries across the world come to Ireland to attend this event. This year Web Summit is bringing 21 Summits (including Food, Enterprise, Machine, Marketing and Builders), over 1,000 speakers and major companies such as Facebook, Google, Disney, Airbnb. Web Summit is one of the only events in the RDS that uses all of it's venue. However with the exponentially growing number of attendees and speakers, our biggest venue in Ireland is unable to contain the numbers.  In recent news, Web Summit will be relocating to Lisbon, Portugal. One of the reasons for the move is the infrastructure.

> "Lisbon is a great city with a thriving start-up community. What's more, it has great transport and hotel infrastructure and a state-of-the-art venue with capacity for more than 80,000 attendees." 

Dublin cannot provide the hotels, venues or transportation system needed by the ever-growing annual conference. The quality of the wi-fi in the RDS as well as the pricing of hotels rooms were some unhappy points the co-founder Paddy Cosgrave found.
