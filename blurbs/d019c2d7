www.geek.com reports on how researchers at the University of Edmonton used a Machine Learning algorithm called Counter Factual Regret Minimization (CFR for short) to weakly solve the game of Heads-up limit Texas hold'em poker. The researchers don't claim that there system will win every hand, rather that over an infinite(or atleast very large) number of hands their system will win more hands than it will loose. The problem was considered interesting as no game with incomplete information, played competitively by humans, has ever been solved.  

In a very high level sense the CFR algorithm works by associating a level of 'regret' with each move it makes, over time the algorithm attempts to minimize total regret. To avoid disregarding potentially successful plays because they were unsuccessful in the past the algorithm revisits previous decisions and readjusts the level of regret associated with them based on how much impact they have had on the game subsequently. Initially the algorithm will make random moves, but over time will learn the best move to make in each situation based on minimal regret.

Since the algorithm learns in real-time there is no need for a data set to train the algorithm. This may seem somewhat inefficient as the algorithm has to start from scratch every game, but since there is so much variance in how different humans play, and how the same human plays but at different times, the idea of training or back testing is not really applicable.
