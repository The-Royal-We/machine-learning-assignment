Magic: the Gathering is a popular card game with a very deep set of rules. Morgan Milewicz a Ph.D student in the University of Alabama decided to create a recurrent neural network to try and learn about the game and create cards of its own from its understanding. The Network had access to every card ever created for the game (over 10,000 cards), all in a basic text format and mined through to attempt to learn how the game worked. It was designed to analyse each character and predict which character would come next. So if "Creatur" was read in or output, it would know that "e" would have to follow. This extended to words afterwards, to the extent that if "draw two" was to appear it would know that the word "card" would follow. This is done using a deep LSTM (long short-term memory), This is a multi layered network, comprised of smaller network units capable of storing and forgetting inputs it receives. With this it is able to reverse engineer the rules of the game quite easily and become smarter the more it mines. While the network began with fumbles with misspelled words such as "Mointainpail" instead of "Mountainwalk", As the network was exposed to more cards it was able to remember certain connections and make better predictions based off the mined data and its own previous predictions. The network began to make more robust predictions and creations very quickly, recognising certain abilities went with certain colours, creature types and spells. It also would create abilities of its own as it did not really know what the words meant, only that the characters are often seen together. An example of this is "Fuseback" a concoction of two abilities "Fuse" and "Flashback", it combined them together knowing that F was frequently followed by both of those strings.
