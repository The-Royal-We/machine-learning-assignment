Machine Learning Assignment One

Machine Learning is the ability of a computer to make predictions based on given algorithms and inputted data. It is a subset of artificial intelligence based on building model outputs from decisions rather than follow strict programming principles. A recent example of this would be LinkedIn's new "FeatureFu" application for programmers.

FeatureFu is intended to aid programmers by creating new higher quality data for clusterisation, normalisation and processing based on existing programming algorithms that already exist. This application is designed to be used primarily in large, data driven applications to aid how the data is visualised on these larger, data holding applications. An example from LinkedIn themselves, is how this application works on their user's news feeds on their personal website. Most social networking websites (like LinkedIn) wish to keep track of each individual users historical likes and preferences so that they can be given a story feed that relates to the information they want to see and have previously indicated an interest in (via likes and shares), normally this is completed using a rigid coding method that weighs the value of each like using a mathematical algorithm and any change that the company wishes to make to this algorithm requires a new code deployment.

With FeatureFu only minor changes need to be made to the mathematical expression of the code as it includes an authe like to weight ratio to be much more smooth and agile, making the news feed for users of the website much more relevant to their indicated interests and minimising the amount of time it takes to make changes to the system's internal code. to be much more smooth and
