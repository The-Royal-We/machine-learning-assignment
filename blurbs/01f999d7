Machine learning algorithms could predict breast cancer treatment responses.

Researchers from Western University in California are developing machine learning algorithms to determine the most likely response to medication for cancer treatment. Their goal is to improve the ability for doctors to be able to prescribe the most appropriate chemotherapy medication for patients. It is a difficult task to determine what medication to give a cancer patient as the patient may be resistant or sensitive to the drugs and it is common that the same treatment for the same type of cancer can put one patient into remission but cause another patient to deteriorate. The earlier that doctors can identify which will be the most effective medication, the more likely they can treat or possibly even cure that patient.

For their research they concentrated on 350 patients with breast cancer who were being treated with at least one of the two chemotherapy drugs paclitaxel and gemcitabine. Taking a set of 40 genes that are found in 90 per cent of breast cancer tumors, the researchers analysed data from cell lines and tumor tissue samples to identify associations between the drug and patient genes. The machine learning algorithms were able to predict gemcitabine resistance and paclitaxel sensitivity with 84% accuracy, paclitaxel resistance with 82% accuracy, and gemcitabine response (i.e. remission or not) with 62-71% accuracy. The researchers plan to add more data so they can refine the genetic signatures and improve the predictions further.
