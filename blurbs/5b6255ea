The article I found interesting regarding machine learning in the modern press is an article based on how researchers are trying to use the process of machine learning algorithms to try predict breast cancer treatment responses and which treatment a patient will respond best to. This algorithm if successful would be incredibly useful as the quicker the cancer is treated the more effective the medication used is and could even possibly cure the cancer. a patient presents with. As nearly 1.7 million new cases of breast cancer in women were diagnosed worldwide in 2012 alone, researchers have a great interest in trying to make the treatment of this more efficent and successful. The researchers in this article complied there data by using a set of 40 genes that are found in 90 per cent of breast cancer tumors for their analysis of data from cell lines and tumor tissues samples from around 350 cancer patients who were treated with at least one of the two chemotherapy drugs(paclitaxel, gemcitabine). Using a machine learning algorithm that is designed to crunch the data and identify associations between the drug and patient genes. The data allowed tge researchers to accurately predict 84 per cent of women who went into remission after undergoing the reatment with the drug paclitaxel. Gemcitabines genetic signature however was able to predict remission accurately 62 to 71 per cent of the time using preserved tumor tissue. Researchers now plan to refine this algorithm and feed the system more data to improve the predictions and hopefully through this the treatment of cancer will improve greatly and reduce the number of people effected by it.
