How can we predict the stock market? That is the crucial problem for the investors. However, now computer scientists have found that we can use just the Twitters to predict the stock market through machine learning. They obtained a collection of public tweets that was recorded from February 28, 2008 to December 19, 2008 (9,853,498 tweets posted by approximately 2.7 M users). The most important machine learning tools they used is the OpinionFinder and the GPOMS (the OF is used to determine whether one tweet has positive or negative attitude, and the GPOMS is used to determine the dimension of one tweet: calm, alert, sure, vital, kind or happy). The result is fascinating. They find the calm mood can successfully predict some public events like the President Election and the calm mood plus the happy mood can give a very precise prediction of the trend (up or down) of the stock market. We all know the common knowledge that people buy stock sometimes just follow their heart, so there must be some connection between the public mood and the stock market. There are so many things to explore in this area and the machine learning is the best way to realize it.
